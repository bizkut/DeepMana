# 📜 Changelog

All notable changes to the HearthstoneOne project.

## [2026-01-04] — Simulator Mechanics V1.1 (Tradeable, Forge, Magnetic)

### ✨ Added
- **Tradeable Logic** — AI can now trade cards (1 mana) to shuffle them into the deck and draw a replacement.
- **Forge Logic** — Added support for upgrading cards in hand (2 mana).
- **Expanded Targeting** — Redesigned the AI action space (300 indices) to support full targeting of friendly minions.
- **Magnetic Support** — AI can now choose specific friendly Mechs to fuse with when playing Magnetic minions.

### 🔧 Changed
- **Graveyard Order** — Deaths are now resolved strictly by `summon_timestamp`, ensuring correct deathrattle sequences.
- **Action space** — Increased `PLAY_CARD` target resolution from 10 to 20 slots per card.

### 🧪 Fixed
- **Missing Actions** — Enabled `TRADE` and `FORGE` actions in the `HearthstoneGame` wrapper for training.

## [2026-01-04] — Fairness & Turbo Performance

### ✨ Added
- **Turbo Configuration** — Added support for `training_config.json` to optimize workers (up to 15) and MCTS simulations for high-end CPUs (AMD Ryzen 5800X).
- **Persistent Analytics** — Training statistics (Loss, Winrate, Buffer) are now saved to `training_history.json`, ensuring dashboard data survives restarts.
- **Plot Enhancements** — Added markers to analytics graphs for visibility even with a single data point.
- **Reset Utility** — Created `tools/reset_training.py` to quickly clear models and history for fresh starts.

### 🔧 Changed
- **Balanced Self-Play** — Random perspective assignment in `data_collector.py` (AI can be P1 or P2) and confirmed "The Coin" (`GAME_005`) logic for P2.
- **Effect Package Scoping** — Fixed `EffectCache` to correctly set `__package__`, allowing relative imports within card effects.

### 🧪 Fixed
- **Double Draw Bug** — Resolved issue where players drew 2 cards instead of 1 at the start of their turn.
- **Multiprocessing NameErrors** — Fixed worker crashes caused by undefined `hero1`/`hero2` in `reset()` and missing `encoder` instance.
- **Maze Guide Import** — Fixed `ModuleNotFoundError` in `REV_308` by removing invalid `simulator.rng` dependency and streamlining the effect.
- **CSS Lints** — Corrected multiple syntax and property errors in `gui/style.css`.

## [2026-01-03] — Training Pipeline Stability & Sideboard Fix

### ✨ Added
- **Dual Deck Format** — `meta_decks.json` now supports both `"code"` (deckstrings) and `"cards"` (direct ID lists).
- **Starcraft Card Effects** — Implemented SC_759 (Shield Battery), SC_760 (Resonance Coil), SC_764 (Sentry), SC_783 (Void Ray).
- **Additional Effects** — TIME_432 (Intertwined Fate), TLC_100 (Elise the Navigator), CORE_AV_329 (Thrive in the Shadows).

### 🔧 Changed
- **`simulator/deck_generator.py`** — Refactored `_load_meta_decks()` to return list format with dual format support.
- **`gui/tabs/decks_tab.py`** — Updated to handle both deckstring and direct card list formats.
- **Sideboard Filter** — Added intelligent filtering to ignore corrupted sideboard entries (count > 2, dbfId < 100).

### 🧪 Fixed
- **Multiprocessing Crash** — Resolved `QObject: Cannot create children for a parent in different thread` by isolating stdout redirection.
- **Sideboard Parsing Bug** — Fixed Zilliax/E.T.C. deck codes that caused `too many values to unpack` errors.
- **Protoss Priest Deck** — Corrected card IDs (CORE_AV_329 → CS3_028) and added all 30 cards manually.
- **Wisp Fallback** — Added safety fallback with WARNING logs for unknown card IDs.

## [2026-01-03] — Meta Decks JSON & Starcraft Support

### ✨ Added
- **`data/meta_decks.json`** — Externalized deck definitions for easier management.
- **Starcraft Custom Set** — Implemented effects for Photon Cannon, Artanis, Mothership.
- **Custom User Decks** — Added support for user-provided "New Priest" and "New Warlock" archetypes.
- **Data Improver** — `CardDatabase` now prioritizes `data/cards.json` and applies patches from `data/manual_cards.json` to fix missing 2026 cards.

### 🔧 Changed
- **`simulator/deck_generator.py`** — Major refactor to load decks from JSON files dynamically.
- **`gui/tabs/decks_tab.py`** — Updated to consume the new JSON-based deck generator.
- **Model Reset** — Purged old checkpoints to allow fresh training on the fully corrected dataset.

### 🧪 Fixed
- **"Unknown Card" Bug** — Resolved issues with missing DBF IDs by utilizing `manual_cards.json` patches and verifying against HSGuru codes.

- **Stop Button** — Safe training interruption mechanism in `trainer.py`.

### 🔧 Fixed
- **Nozdormu Crash** — Implemented native `dormant` mechanic to prevent simulated crashes.
